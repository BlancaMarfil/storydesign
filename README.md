Are you a writer? Do you have a million stories in your head? This application helps you to have all your ideas organized.
Add the stories you're working on or planning to work on in the future. Even if it's just a little notion that just came into your head, add it now so you don't forget it.
Design the characters of your stories and add them to several stories if you're brave enough to write duologies, triologies or even larger series.
Finally, plan the timeline of your stories so you can control what happens in each one of them and don't end up confused and mixing villains with heroes.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
